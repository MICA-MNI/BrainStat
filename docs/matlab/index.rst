MATLAB Index
============

For MATLAB tutorials, we recommend viewing these either through the Examples tab
on our FileExchange_ page, or by opening the files in MATLAB
(:code:`PACKAGE_DIRECTORY/tutorials`). Alternatively, we've also included copies
of these live scripts in ReadTheDocs:

- :ref:`matlab_tutorial1`
- :ref:`matlab_tutorial2`
