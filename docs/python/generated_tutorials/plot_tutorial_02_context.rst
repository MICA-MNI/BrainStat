Tutorial 02: Context Decoding
=========================================

In this tutorial you will learn about the context decoding tools included with
BrainStat. The context decoding module consists of three parts: genetic
decoding, meta-analytic decoding and histological comparisons. First, we'll
consider how to run the genetic decoding analysis. 


Genetics
--------

For genetic decoding we use the Allen Human Brain Atlas through the abagen
toolbox. Note that abagen only accepts parcellated data. Here is a minimal
example of how we use abagen to get the genetic expression of the 400 regions
of the Schaefer atlas. Please note that downloading the dataset and running this
analysis can take several minutes.

Expression is a pandas DataFrame which shows the genetic expression of genes
within each region of the atlas. By default, the values will fall in the range
[0, 1] where higher values represent higher expression. However, if you change
the normalization function then this may change. Some regions may return NaN
values for all genes. This occurs when there are no samples within this
region across all donors.

By default, BrainStat uses all the default abagen parameters. If you wish to
customize these parameters then the keyword arguments can be passed directly
to `surface_genetic_expression`. For a full list of these arguments and their
function please consult the abagen documentation.

Meta-Analytic
-------------
To perform meta-analytic decoding, BrainStat uses precomputed Neurosynth maps.
Here we test which terms are most associated with a map of cortical thickness.
A simple example analysis can be run as follows. First, we will load some
cortical thickness data and two cortical surfaces. The ABIDE dataset provides
this data on the CIVET surface, so we will also load those surfaces. The
surface decoder interpolates the data from the surface to the voxels in the
volume that are in between the two input surfaces.

meta_analysis now contains a pandas.dataFrame with the correlation values
for each requested feature. If no feature was requested (like here) then
the analysis is run across all features.


Histological decoding
---------------------
For histological decoding we use microstructural profile covariance gradients,
as first shown by (Paquola et al, 2019, Plos Biology), computed from the
BigBrain dataset. Firstly, lets download the MPC data and compute its
gradients.

The variable histology_profiles now contains histological profiles sampled at
50 different depths across the cortex, mpc contains the covariance of these
profiles, and gradient_map contains their gradients. Depending on your
use-case, each of these variables could be of interest, but for purposes of
this tutorial we'll plot the gradients to the surface with BrainSpace. For
details on what the GradientMaps class, gm, contains please consult the

Note that we no longer use the y-axis regression used in (Paquola et al, 2019,
Plos Biology), as such the first gradient becomes an anterior-posterior-
gradient.

Resting-state contextualization
-------------------------------
Lastly, BrainStat provides contextualization using resting-state fMRI markers:
specifically, with the Yeo functional networks (Yeo et al., 2011, Journal of
Neurophysiology), a clustering of resting-state connectivity, and the
functional gradients (Margulies et al., 2016, PNAS), a lower dimensional
manifold of resting-state connectivity.

As an example, lets have a look at the first functional gradient within the
Yeo networks.

Unsurprisingly, the gradients are very similar to the Yeo networks, with
higher gradient values in higher order networks and lower values in lower
order networks.

There are many ways to compare these gradients to cortical markers such as
cortical thickness. In general, we recommend using corrections for spatial
autocorrelation which are implemented in BrainSpace. We'll show a correction
with spin test in this tutorial; for other methods and further details please
consult the BrainSpace tutorials.

In a spin test we compare the empirical correlation between the gradient and
the cortical marker to a distribution of correlations derived from data
rotated across the cortical surface. The p-value then depends on the
percentile of the empirical correlation within the permuted distribution.
