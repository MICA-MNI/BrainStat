Tutorial 01: Linear Models
=========================================
In this tutorial you will set up your first linear model with BrainStat. 
To this end, we will load some sample data from the ABIDE dataset. Note that,
contrary to the results shown in our manuscript, we are only using a few sites
to reduce computation time in this tutorial. As such the results shown here
differ from those reported in our manuscript. To get identical results,
simply set `sites` to `None`.

Next, lets see whether cortical thickness is related to age in our sample
data. To this end we can create a linear model with BrainStat. First we
declare the behavioral variables as FixedEffects. The FixedEffect class can be
created in two ways: either we provide the data with pandas, as we do here, or
we provide a numpy array and a name for the fixed effect. Once, that's done we
can create the model by simply adding the terms together. Lets set up a model
with age and patient status as fixed effects.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-60

.. code-block:: default


    from brainstat.stats.terms import FixedEffect

    term_age = FixedEffect(demographics.AGE_AT_SCAN)
    # Subtract 1 from DX_GROUP so patient == 0 and healthy == 1.
    term_patient = FixedEffect(demographics.DX_GROUP - 1)
    model = term_age + term_patient








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-63

As said before, if your data is not in a pandas DataFrame (e.g. numpy), you'll
have to provide the name of the effect as an additional parameter as follows:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-65

.. code-block:: default

    term_age_2 = FixedEffect(demographics.AGE_AT_SCAN.to_numpy(), "AGE_AT_SCAN")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-69

Beside simple fixed effects, we may also be interested in interaction
effects. We can add these to the model by multiplying terms. Lets
create a model with an interaction between age and patient status.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-72

.. code-block:: default


    model_interaction = term_age + term_patient + term_age * term_patient








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-77

Lets have a look at one of these models. As you can see below, the model
is stored in a format closely resembling a pandas DataFrame. Note that an
intercept is automatically added to the model. This behavior can be disabled
in the FixedEffect call, but we recommend leaving it enabled.

Now, imagine we have some cortical marker (e.g. cortical thickness) for
each subject, and we want to evaluate whether this marker changes with age
whilst correcting for effects of patient status. To do this, we can use
the model we defined before, and a contrast in observations (here: age).
Then we simply initialize an SLM model and fit it to the cortical thickness
data.

By default BrainStat uses a two-tailed test. If you want to get a one-tailed
test, simply specify it in the SLM model initialization with
`two_tailed=False`. Note that the one-tailed test will test for positive
t-values. If you want to test for negative t-values, simply invert the
contrast. We may hypothesize based on prior research that cortical thickness
decreases with age, so we could specify this as follows:

It appears we do not find statistically significant results for a relationship
between cortical thickness and patient status.

Now, imagine that instead of using a fixed effects model, you would prefer a
mixed effects model wherein the scanning site is a random variable. This is
simple to set up. All you need to do is initialize the site term with the
MixedEffect class, all other code remains identical.

Lets have a closer look at the mixed effect. The variable random_site contains
two important properties: "mean", and "variance". "mean" contains any fixed effects,
whereas "variance" contains the random effects. As we did not specify any fixed
effects, the "mean" term is empty. The "variance" term contains the random effect as
well as the identity term, similar to the intercept in FixedEffects. The identity term
is added by default.
