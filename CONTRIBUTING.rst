Welcome to BrainStat! We're happy you want to contribute.

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an `issue <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainStat/issues>`_!

Before you start you'll need to set up a free `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ account and sign in. Here are some `instructions <https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/>`_.
If you are not familiar with version control systems such as git, please see these
`introductions and tutorials <http://www.reproducibleimaging.org/module-reproducible-basics/02-vcs/>`_.

Issue labels
============
.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/-bugs-fc2929.svg
    :alt: Bugs

*These issues point to problems in the project.*

If you find new a bug, please provide as much information as possible to
recreate the error. The issue template will automatically
populate any new issue you open, and contains information we've found to be
helpful in addressing bug reports. Please fill it out to the best of your
ability!

If you experience the same bug as one already listed in an open issue, please
add any additional information that you have as a comment.

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-c2e0c6.svg
    :alt: Help

*These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.*

If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we encourage you to
do so! Issues that are also labelled as
[good-first-issue][link_good_first_issue] are a great place to start if you're
looking to make your first contribution.

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/-enhancement-00FF09.svg
    :alt: Enhancement

*These issues are asking for new features to be added to the project.*

Please try to make sure that your requested enhancement is distinct from any
others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's
similar but there are subtle differences, please reference the other request in
your issue.

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/-orphaned-9baddd.svg
    :alt: Orphaned

*These pull requests have been closed for inactivity.*

Before proposing a new pull request, browse through the "orphaned" pull requests.
You may find that someone has already made significant progress toward your goal, and you can re-use their
unfinished work.
An adopted PR should be updated to merge or rebase the current master, and a new PR should be created (see
below) that references the original PR.

|matlab| and |python|

.. |matlab| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/-matlab-f9d0c4.svg

.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/-python-162b70.svg

*These issues are specific to the MATLAB/Python implementation of BrainStat.*

Please note that, whenever feasible, for new functionality we try to add it to
both implementations. Don't have experience with either language? The BrainStat
team may be able to help you convert your changes. 

===============

We appreciate all contributions to BrainStat, but those accepted fastest will
follow a workflow similar to the following:

**1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**

This allows other members of the BrainStat development team to confirm that you
aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on
the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

`This blog <https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/>`_
is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to
everyone involved.

**2. Fork the BrainStat repository to your profile.**

This is now your own unique copy of the BrainStat repository.
Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to keep your fork up to date with the original BrainStat repository.
One way to do this is to `configure a new remote named "upstream" <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/>`_ and to `sync your fork with the upstream repository <https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/>`_.

**3. Submit a pull request.**

A new pull request for your changes should be created from your fork of the repository.

When opening a pull request, please use one of the following prefixes:

* **[ENH]** for enhancements
* **[FIX]** for bug fixes
* **[TST]** for new or updated tests
* **[DOC]** for new or updated documentation
* **[STY]** for stylistic changes
* **[REF]** for refactoring existing code
* **[GIT]** for github-related changes

Pull requests should be submitted early and often (please don't mix too many unrelated changes within one PR)!
If your pull request is not yet ready to be merged, please also include the **[WIP]** prefix (you can remove it once your PR is ready to be merged).
This tells the development team that your pull request is a "work-in-progress", and that you plan to continue working on it.

Review and discussion on new code can begin well before the work is complete, and the more discussion the better!
The development team may prefer a different path than you've outlined, so it's better to discuss it and get approval at the early stage of your work.

One your PR is ready a member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

Notes for New Code
==================

Testing
-------
New code should be tested, whenever feasible.
Bug fixes should include an example that exposes the issue.
Any new features should have tests that show at least a minimal example.
If you're not sure what this means for your code, please ask in your pull request.

Recognizing contributions
-------------------------
We welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development.

The development team member who accepts/merges your pull request will include your name in in the list of contributors. 

**Thank you! You're awesome.**
